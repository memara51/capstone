My compilable task was allowing the calculator to access emails based on who logs in. 
I have a good out line of how many functions are going to be needed and how they each will be implemented to work, and have started working on coding the functions on arduino IDE 


void buildEmailListPages() 
{
    Serial.println("Building email list pages...");  // arduino Cout

    // Reset varaibles
    emailCount = 0;
    fullResponse = "";

    // If no emails, set error or do minimal line
    if (gAllMsgs.empty()) {
        Serial.println("No messages in gAllMsgs"); // arduino COUT
        fullResponse = "No emails loaded.";
        
    }
