My compilable task was allowing the calculator to access emails based on who logs in. 
I have a good out line of how many functions are going to be needed and how they each will be implemented to work, and have started working on coding the functions on arduino IDE 


void buildEmailListPages() 
{
    Serial.println("Building email list pages...");  // arduino Cout

    // Reset varaibles
    emailCount = 0;
    fullResponse = "";

    // If no emails, set error or do minimal line
    if (gAllMsgs.empty()) {
        Serial.println("No messages in gAllMsgs"); // arduino COUT
        fullResponse = "No emails loaded.";
        
    }
rubric:
10 points - logging in successfully into email
10 points -  accessing the emails
10 points -  sending emails
10 points - receiving emails in real time. 


Time log:

Date                                   hours   

Friday 3/14                         1 hour  - doing research and getting a good grasp before springbreak                   

Sunday 3/23                      2 hours  - doing more research                           

Wednesday  3/26(lab time)              1 hour  – downloading arduino IDE, making the file and outlining the functions and their what each function should return, what should be the parameters etc.

Thursday 3/27 (after class, whole group meeting)      1 hour  - group discussion about progress what needs to be made and changed etc


Sunday 3/30                1 hour    – working as well as testing the first function. 




why and how we might be able to help overcome any technical issues.

I think to overcome any technical issues we need to use teamwork and communication since we all need to work together and maintain a strict timeline so that the project doesn’t fall behind and to be understanding of each other. The hardest part was fully diving into the arduino IDE it uses C++ but has certain different things that you need to get used to after getting used to it it was pretty easy to understand and get used to the differences.
